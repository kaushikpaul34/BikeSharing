## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short-term basis for a price or free.
- US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. 
The company is finding it very difficult to sustain itself in the current market scenario. 
So, it has decided to devise a mindful business plan to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown ends, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. 
They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better, 
stand out from other service providers, and make huge profits.
- To model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 
They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. 
Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 
- Rented bike sharing data from 2018 to 2019.

## Conclusions
- The total no of bike rented gradually increases from spring to fall season and then decreases at winter season.
- Total no of rented bikes increased significantly from 2018 to 2019.
- Rented bike number declines if weather is not suitable, maximum no of bikes rented when weather is clear.
- Bike rented number increases gradually from Jan to July, then becomes stable till sept, number declines from sept to Dec.
- With the increase in temperature, bike rented number increases.

## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.0
